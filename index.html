    <h3><b><i>Parlez-vous HTML?</i></b></h3>

    <p>When we think of language, we generally think of the words we use to communicate with each other on a daily basis, whether spoken or written.
      Perhaps we think of foreign languages, like French or Spanish. However, we also need language to communicate with machines. (After all, our computers aren't yet able to read lips.) This is where coding
      languages like HTML come in. <i>HTML</i> stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>t</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage and is a standardized system used to create
      web pages that can include a variety of effects from font and color to hyperlinks. An essential compontent to HTML are <i>semantic elements</i>.
      Semantic elements are various tags applied to pieces of text that provide meaning to both the developer and the browser. Simply put, semantic elements
      define the various parts of a webpage so that it can be understood by both man and machine. Let's take a look at some examples!</p>
